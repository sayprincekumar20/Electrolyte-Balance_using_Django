## Electrolyte Balance Prediction System (Using Django)
This project is an end-to-end web application built with the Django framework that predicts electrolyte imbalances based on medical test results. The system leverages machine learning techniques and a Random Forest Classifier to assess imbalances in electrolytes, providing accurate predictions that can assist doctors and healthcare professionals in diagnosing potential health issues efficiently.

# Key Features:
* User-friendly interface: Built using Django, HTML, and CSS for ease of use.
* Machine Learning Integration: A Random Forest Classifier trained on a medical dataset to predict imbalances in key electrolytes such as Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, and Magnesium.
* Automation: Automates electrolyte analysis, reducing the time required for healthcare professionals to assess data by approximately 5 minutes per patient.
* Scalability: The app allows for integration with medical labs, making it easier to analyze electrolyte test results in bulk.
## Technical Overview:
* Backend: Django framework (Python)
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Django templates
* Modeling: Random Forest Classifier with a feature scaling process (StandardScaler)
* Data: Key features like 'Serum Sodium', 'Serum Potassium', 'Serum Calcium', and more were used for the prediction.
* Deployment: Saved models and scalers using joblib for efficient reuse in production.
## Impact:
* Healthcare Efficiency: Helps medical labs automate the electrolyte prediction process, assisting doctors in quickly identifying imbalances, which leads to faster and more accurate treatment decisions.
* Time-saving: Streamlined the test analysis process, cutting down the time needed to analyze results for each patient.
## This project highlights the application of machine learning in healthcare and showcases the integration of a prediction model within a web-based framework for real-world use.
